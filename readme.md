Hound
=====
A wav encoding and decoding library in Rust.

Hound can read and write the WAVE audio format, an ubiquitous format for raw,
uncompressed audio. The main motivation to write it was to test
[Claxon][claxon], a FLAC decoding library written in Rust.

Examples
--------
The following example renders a 440 Hz sine wave, and stores it as a mono wav
file with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and 16 bits per sample.

```rust
use std::f32::consts::PI;
use std::i16;
use hound;

let spec = hound::WavSpec {
    channels: 1,
    sample_rate: 44100,
    bits_per_sample: 16,
    sample_format: hound::SampleFormat::Int,
};
let mut writer = hound::WavWriter::create("sine.wav", spec).unwrap();
for t in (0 .. 44100).map(|x| x as f32 / 44100.0) {
    let sample = (t * 440.0 * 2.0 * PI).sin();
    let amplitude = i16::MAX as f32;
    writer.write_sample((sample * amplitude) as i16).unwrap();
}
```

The file is finalized implicitly when the writer is dropped, call
`writer.finalize()` to observe errors.

The following example computes the root mean square (RMS) of an audio file with
at most 16 bits per sample.

```rust
use hound;

let mut reader = hound::WavReader::open("testsamples/pop.wav").unwrap();
let sqr_sum = reader.samples::<i16>()
                    .fold(0.0, |sqr_sum, s| {
    let sample = s.unwrap() as f64;
    sqr_sum + sample * sample
});
println!("RMS is {}", (sqr_sum / reader.len() as f64).sqrt());
```

Status
------
This project is mature and maintained, but only in little spare time. Generally
only the latest major version receives fixes, but fixes are sometimes backported
on a case-by-case basis.

Minimum supported Rust version
------------------------------

 * Hound supports at a minimum the Rust versions younger than 3 years at the
   time of a Hound release. For example, a release on 2020-06-03 would support
   Rust 1.18.0, released on 2017-06-08, but it might not support Rust 1.17.0,
   released on 2017-04-27.
 * Compatibility is always stated in the changelog.
 * Hound tests on CI against the oldest supported version and the current stable
   Rust version, but not every individual version in between.
